🎉 Eventive – Event Management System

Eventive is a full-stack Event Management System designed to simplify and digitize the complete event lifecycle — from event creation and promotion to attendee registration, ticketing, and communication.

This project is developed as part of the Aptech eProject to demonstrate real-world application development using modern web technologies.

📌 Introduction

Managing events using traditional or manual systems often results in inefficiencies, data mismanagement, and poor attendee engagement. Organizers usually rely on multiple tools for promotion, registration, ticketing, and communication, which creates a fragmented workflow.

Eventive solves these challenges by offering a centralized, web-based platform that enables seamless interaction between event organizers and attendees, ensuring better organization, transparency, and user experience.

❗ Problem Statement

Existing event management systems and manual processes suffer from:

Decentralized and scattered information

Time-consuming manual registration

Limited promotional reach

Ineffective communication with attendees

Complex ticketing and payment handling

Higher chances of human error

These limitations make event management inefficient and difficult to scale.

✅ Proposed Solution – Eventive

Eventive is an all-in-one event management platform that streamlines event planning and execution.
