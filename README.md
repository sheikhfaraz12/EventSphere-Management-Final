🎉 Eventive – Event Management System

Eventive is a full-stack Event Management System designed to simplify the entire event lifecycle — from event creation and promotion to registration, ticketing, and attendee management. The system provides a centralized platform for Organizers and Attendees, ensuring efficiency, transparency, and better user experience.
